# Notes:
This is a spring boot application that connects to a postgres database.
The orginal app was picked form https://github.com/mkjelland/spring-boot-postgres-on-k8s-sample
The original app deploys the postgress db and the spring boot app sepeartely.
I have combined the 2 into one helm chart.

In the original app the ip address of the db was used to connect to it by running the command afetr pg deployment;
kubectl delete configmap hostname-config
# this line exacts the ip address of the postgress installation an put it's into the the configmap, a key value/pair, this postgres_host varible will be used by the spring boot app.
kubectl create configmap hostname-config --from-literal=postgres_host=$(kubectl get svc dennis-pg-postgresql  -o jsonpath="{.spec.clusterIP}")

In the combined helm chart I have used  the name of the db host rather than the ip adddress to connect to it.

How I made the combined helm chart of postgress db  and spring boot app:
-Pick pg helm files from https://github.com/cetic/helm-postgresql and put it in helm-chart
- Add file spring-boot-appLocal.yml  and spring-boot-configmap.yaml under helm-chart\templates\ 
-----------------------------------------------
Commands:

kubectl delete service sbpd-exposed
helm uninstall dennis-pg
helm install dennis-pg ./helm-chart/
kubectl expose deployment spring-boot-postgres-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=8084 --target-port 8080 --name=sbpd-exposed
kubectl get svc  sbpd-exposed


-------------------------------------------
misc - for reference only, they are not needed for running the abouve commands
----------------------------------------------


If only postgres were to be deployed: 
From: https://hub.helm.sh/charts/cetic/postgresql


helm repo add cetic https://cetic.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm delete  dennis-pg
helm install dennis-pg cetic/postgresql
or 
helm install -f postgres-new-values.yaml dennis-pg cetic/postgresql  # wordpress-new-values.yaml obtained from https://github.com/cetic/helm-postgresql/blob/master/values.yaml



#if you want to see it in your local machine
kubectl port-forward --namespace default svc/postgres 5432:5432


helm install --dry-run  dennis-pg ./helm-chart/
